## Session 1
Character creation and a lil roleplay.

### Angus
- Likes the simple attributes
- Likes allocating dice to tables
- Starting gear felt surprisingly coherent
- Likes the setting (Old Europe Latin/Catholic church island)
- Likes 'Numbered Hallways' ( Clear decision points )
- Give more coins to buy things with
- When players roll the same starting items:
    - Keep the 'add a quirk' but get original player to roll again
- Remove the used items completely and add something else
- Don't tone down the gear, just don't play into what you don't want to

### Anton
- Start with too much stuff, felt pressure to embody all of them
    - Halve the number of tables, buy more selectively instead
    - Give more leeway with undesirable rolls
- Tone of starting equipment tables was silly when the setting was not

### Eugene
- Swap dice results of two tables once
- Simplify starting equipment, encourage players to embellish

### Potential Changes
:heavy_check_mark: Replace the silliest of starting items ( Belching, fetal alcohol, stuttering? )

:heavy_check_mark: Make the coin roll a permanent feature and worth more than the number rolled on die. Potentially 2x or 3x

:heavy_check_mark: Allow a single die swap on starting gear or a single reroll

:heavy_minus_sign: Ask Anton for an improvement to his madlibs idea if he has one

- :heavy_minus_sign: Related: More character input 'mechanics' like this on character creation

:heavy_minus_sign: Tone down some of the most prescriptive items
