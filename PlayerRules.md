# Player Rules
## Characters
There are three Attributes:
* Strength - measures raw physical power
    * A Strength of 5+ gives a +1 to Hit rolls
* Dexterity - measures speed and deftness of action
    * A Dexterity of 5+ gives a +1 to Dodging saves
* Constitution - measures endurance and health
    * A Constitution of 5+ gives a +1 to Physique saves

They are generated by rolling 1d6 for each or assigning 10 points accross all three.
    * No Attribute can be lower than 1 or higher than 6

There are three Saves:
* Dodging - used to get out of the way fast. This begins at 3
* Physique - used to fight off disease and exhaustion. This begins at 3
* Warding - used to resist magic. This begins at 2

Characters foregoing Armour add 2 to their Dodging save.
Characters wearing Light Armour add 1 to their Dodging save.
Characters wearing Heavy Armour subtract 1 from their Dodging save.

Characters begin play with:
* 3d6*10 hacksilver worth of equipment. Anything not spent is lost
* 1 Hit Die. This is rolled to determine their starting Hit Points
* An attack roll of 3
* Knowing 1d6/2 languages
    * A language can be 'half-known' - enough to conduct trade
    * All characters should share at least one 'half-known' language - the speech of their ex-captors
    * Language slots can be 'held' for later use, but a character must declare they know a language the first time they hear it
    * If a language is known 'twice', the character is able to read and write in it
* Sharing a small raiding vessel (_Karvi_) with their fellow characters and twelve rowers - fellow ex-thralls who look to you for leadership. There is enough food and water for all hands to survive for four days. You have travelled two days from the home of your captors.

## Equipment

## Core Resolution Mechanics
### Checks
When a character is attempting to do something that cannot be resolved through discussion and failure has meaningful consequences, the humble check is employed. A character rolls a number of d6 equal to their most relevant Attribute and attempts to score successes equal to or greater than the Obstacle (Ob). All dice showing a 4, 5 or 6 are counted as successes. The obstacle is set by the DM, it starts at 2 and can be increased or decreased depending on the difficulty of the situation. Characters may also add to their dice total through various advantages available to them, including appropriate knowledge, good planning, helpful equipment etc.

### Saves
Saves are called for when a character must react immediately to avoid danger. Saves are resolved similarly to Tests but the character uses their Save rather than their Attribute.

**Note:** Here I've tried to differentiate Tests and Saves by making saves slightly more difficult, they should be pull your ass out of the fire at last moment vibe.
