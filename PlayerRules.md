# Player Rules
## Design Goals
* Equipment based (no classes or skills)
* Light (few rules, easy to learn)
* Tight (mechanics are tightly coupled)
* Minimal DM overhead
* Interesting player choice at all stages

## Characters
There are three Attributes:
* Strength - measures raw physical power and endurance
* Dexterity - measures speed and deftness of action
* Willpower - measures mental stability and resolve

They are generated by rolling 1d6 for each and swapping two if desired.

Characters begin play with:
* A trinket from their past. Pick or roll and answer the questions out loud to the group
* 3d6*10 hacksilver worth of other equipment. Anything not spent is lost
* d6 HP. This is the damage a character can shrug off before taking more lasting wounds
* 2 Traits. Make them up or roll
* Knowing 1d6/2 languages
    * A language can be 'half-known' - enough to conduct trade
    * All characters should share at least one 'half-known' language - the speech of their ex-captors
    * Language slots can be 'held' for later use, but a character must declare they know a language the first time they hear it
    * If a language is known 'twice', the character is able to read and write in it
* Sharing a small raiding vessel (_Karvi_) with their fellow characters and twelve rowers - fellow ex-thralls who look to you for leadership. There is enough food and water for all hands to survive for four days. You have travelled two days from the home of your ex-captors.

## Equipment

| Battle-axe | 10sp | Medium | Forgo a damage roll to attempt a weapon/shield strip. Make a Strength save to disarm. |

| Polearm | 15sp | Heavy | Make a DEX save anytime an opponent tries to move close to you. If successful, you get a free attack and they halt their advance. |
| Poleaxe | 20sp | Heavy | Can use the special of a battle-axe or polearm but takes one turn to switch stance. |
| Javelin | 5sp | Medium | Throwable. |
| Longbow | 30sp | Medium | Each round spent aiming adds one advantage. |

| Warhammer | 25sp | Heavy | On a 5 or 6, the target is thrown backwards and knocked prone. |

Advantage - Add or subtract 1d6 to the damage roll, whichever would give them better odds according to their weapon weight.
Riposte - If hit by <3 damage, you may make a free attack against the attacker.

_These special abilties are just examples of what a weapon might do. Feel free to discuss with your DM if you have other ideas in a given situation._
### Armour
### Adventuring Tools
### Livestock

## Core Resolution Mechanics
### Saves
When a character is attempting to do something that cannot be resolved through discussion and failure has meaningful consequences, the humble check is employed. A character rolls a number of d6 equal to their most relevant Attribute and attempts to roll a six (success) on at least one die. The number of successes required can be increased by the DM depending on the difficulty of the situation. Characters may also add to their dice total through various advantages available to them, including appropriate knowledge, good planning, helpful equipment etc.
