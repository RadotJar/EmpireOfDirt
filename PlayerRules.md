# Player Rules
## Design Goals
* Equipment based (no classes or skills)
* Light (few rules, easy to learn)
* Tight (mechanics are tightly coupled)
* Minimal DM overhead
* Interesting player choice at all stages

## Characters
There are three Attributes:
* Strength - measures raw physical power and endurance
* Dexterity - measures speed and deftness of action
* Willpower - measures mental stability and resolve

They are generated by rolling 1d6 for each and swapping two if desired.

Characters begin play with:
* A trinket from their past. Pick or roll and answer the questions out loud to the group
* 3d6*10 hacksilver worth of other equipment. Anything not spent is lost
* d6 HP. This is the damage a character can shrug off before taking more lasting wounds
* 2 Traits. Make them up or roll
* Knowing 1d6/2 languages
    * A language can be 'half-known' - enough to conduct trade
    * All characters should share at least one 'half-known' language - the speech of their ex-captors
    * Language slots can be 'held' for later use, but a character must declare they know a language the first time they hear it
    * If a language is known 'twice', the character is able to read and write in it
* Sharing a small raiding vessel (_Karvi_) with their fellow characters and twelve rowers - fellow ex-thralls who look to you for leadership. There is enough food and water for all hands to survive for four days. You have travelled two days from the home of your ex-captors.

## Equipment
Characters have two hand item slots and six body slots. The body slots represent items easily accesible: slung about the body, hanging from the belt etc. Characters can carry more items by wearing containers such as backpacks and satchels but these come with drawbacks. Worn items such as clothes and armour do not take up slots.

### Trinkets
### Weapons
Light weapons roll 2d6 and take the lower die as damage. Medium weapons roll 1d6 as damage. Heavy weapons roll 2d6 and take the higher die as damage.

| Weapon | Cost | Weight | Special |
| ------ | ---- | ------ | ------- |
| Battle-axe | 10sp | Medium | Forgo a damage roll to attempt a weapon/shield strip. |
| Club | 5sp | Light | Forgo a damage roll to attempt a stun. The misses their turn and all attacks against them have advantage this round. |
| Dagger | 5sp | Light | Throwable, ignores armour in grapple situations. |
| Flail | 8sp | Medium | Ignores shields. |
| Greatsword* | 40sp | Heavy | Upon a killing blow, the wielder may attack another target. This can be chained. |

| Javelin | 5sp | Medium | Throwable. |
| Longbow* | 30sp | Medium | Each round spent aiming adds one advantage. |
| Longsword | 12sp | Medium | Riposte once per round |
| Mace | 8sp | Medium | Ignores 1 point of armour. |
| Poleaxe* | 20sp | Heavy | Can use the special of a battle-axe or spear but takes one turn to switch stance. |
| Quarterstaff | 5sp | Light | Gives +1 to any martial-arts type moves attempted with it. |
| Shortbow* | 15sp | Medium | Can fire while moving. |
| Shortsword | 8sp | Light | Riposte twice per round. |
| Sling | 1sp | Light | Can be thrown as a bolas to ensnare a target or used as a strangulation device in close quarters. |
| Spear* | 15sp | Heavy | Make a DEX save anytime an opponent tries to move close to you. If successful, you get a free attack and they halt their advance. |
| Two-Handed Axe* | 25sp | Heavy | If a 6 is rolled for damage, roll another die and add it to the damage. This can be chained. |
| Warhammer* | 25sp | Heavy | On a 5 or 6, the target is thrown backwards and knocked prone. |

\* Requires two hands

Advantage - Add or subtract 1d6 to the damage roll, whichever would give them better odds according to their weapon weight.

Riposte - If hit by <3 damage, you may make a free attack against the attacker.

_These special abilties are just examples of what a weapon might do. You are encouraged to discuss with your DM if you have other ideas in a given combat situation._
### Armour
Light armour provides 1 Armour. Medium armour provides 2 Armour. Heavy armour provides 3 Armour.

| Armour | Cost | Weight | Special |
| ------ | ---- | ------ | ------- |
| Cloak | | Light | Tends to get caught on things. Upon being targeted by 1 damage, you may attempt to catch the attacker's weapon in your cloak and disarm them or throw them off balance. |
| Chain Coif | | Medium | For every piece of undamaged armour, add one additional die to your Armour roll. |
| Chain Leggings | | Heavy | Allow them to be damaged only to wrench yourself free of their blow, pulling them off balance and sending them behind you. |
| Chain Mits | | Medium | Allow them to be damaged to attempt to wrench your opponent's weapon from their grasp. |
| Chain Shirt | | Heavy | Allow it to be damaged to negate all damage from a single slashing attack. |
| Gambeson | | Medium | Once per combat, negate all damage from a single attack. |
| Gauntlets | | Medium | Upon an armour roll negating all damage, may attempt to sucker punch the attacker, causing them to lose their turn and all attacks against them to have advantage for this round. |
| Gloves | | Light | Upon facing only 1 damage from an attack, may attempt to damage one pice of the attacker's armour. |
| Leather Cap | | Light | If you score at least one success on your Armour roll, you automatically negate an additional point of damage. |
| Leather Vambrace | | Light | Forgo an Armour roll to attempt to grappled with the attacker. |
| Padded Coif | | Light | Upon faceing 6 damage, automatically reduce it to 5 before your Armour roll. |
| Padded Tunic | | Light | Automatically negate any bludgeoning attack dealing 1 or 2 damage. |
| Plate Cuirass | | Heavy | When making an Armour roll against a piercing attack, a success allows you to roll another die. This effect can be chained. |
| Plate Helm and Visor | | Heavy | If you would take any damage after your Armour roll, roll the dice contributed by this helm again. | 
| Sabatons and Greaves | | Heavy | Upon an armour roll negating all damage, may attempt a shin/groin kick to cause the attacker to fall into you. |
| Steel Cap Boots | | Medium | Forgo an armour roll to attempt to trip the attacker, knocking them prone. |
| Suede Boots | | Light | Upon facing only 1 damage from an attack, may attempt to vault/slide through the legs of the attacker. |


Damaged - Remove 1 Armour until repaired.

**Note** - This will be written in combat rules later, but each point of "Armour" adds 1d6 to a pool you roll when attacked. Each success negates 1 point of damage.

**Note** - Armour "materials" and "locations" have mechanical themes:
* Materials
    * Chain - Do cool stuff by sacrificing your armour (the ragged roustabout)
    * Padded/Cloth - Do cool stuff when you are lucky enough to receive low damage (the foolish fiend)
    * Plate - Do cool stuff when your armour absorbs all the damage (the tank chad)
    * Leather - Forgo an armour roll to do cool stuff (the risky rapscallion)

* Locations
    * Torso - Is good at absorbing a certain type of damage
    * Hands - Counters
    * Head - Off Material Theme
    * Feet/Legs - Maneuvering

_These special abilties are just examples of what a piece of armour might do. You are encouraged to discuss with your DM if you have other ideas in a given combat situation._


### Adventuring Tools
### Livestock

## Core Resolution Mechanics
### Saves
When a character is attempting to do something that cannot be resolved through discussion and failure has meaningful consequences, the humble check is employed. A character rolls a number of d6 equal to their most relevant Attribute and attempts to roll a six (success) on at least one die. The number of successes required can be increased by the DM depending on the difficulty of the situation. Characters may also add to their dice total through various advantages available to them, including appropriate knowledge, good planning, helpful equipment etc.
