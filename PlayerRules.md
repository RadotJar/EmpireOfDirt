# Player Rules 1.0.0
## Design Goals
* Equipment based (no classes or skills)
* lite (few rules, easy to learn)
* tite (mechanics are titely coupled)
* Minimal DM overhead
* Interesting player choice at all stages

## Characters
There are three Attributes:

* Strength - measures raw physical power and endurance
    * 4 Strength gives +1 Pack slot, 5 gives +2 and 6 gives +4
* Dexterity - measures speed and deftness of action
    * 5 Dexterity gives +1 Quick slot, 6 gives +2
* Willpower - measures mental stability and resolve
    * Willpower determines the number of uses a character can get from a slot of consumables

They are generated by rolling 1d6 for each and swapping two if desired.

Characters begin play with:

* d6 HP. This is the damage a character can shrug off before taking more lasting wounds
* Starting gear as per the **Starting Gear** section
* Knowing 1d6/2 languages
    * A language can be 'half-known' - enough to conduct trade
    * All characters should share at least one 'half-known' language - the speech of their ex-captors
    * Language slots can be 'held' for later use, but a character must declare they know a language the first time they hear it
    * If a language is known 'twice', the character is able to read and write in it
* Sharing a small raiding vessel (_Karvi_) with their fellow characters and twelve rowers - fellow ex-thralls who look to you for leadership. There is enough food and water for all hands to survive for four days. You have traveled two days from the home of your ex-captors.


## Equipment
Characters start with 2 quick slots and 8 pack slots, modified by attribute benefits. Quick slots are easily accessible whereas backpack slots require some degree of rummaging. Most items take up one slot. **Bulky** items take up two slots. Items small enough to fit in a closed hand don't take any slots.

Consumables can be bundled into a single slot, with Willpower determining the maximum number of uses that the slot can provide. 

*Example: a character with 3 Willpower can fill a slot with torches, getting 3 uses out of them.*

### Starting Gear
Each player gets a set of dice: 1d16, 1d14, 1d12, 1d10, 1d8, 1d6 and 1d4. One die is used to generate starting coins ( 3x die value ), the rest are rolled on the starting gear tables. 

Go around the table, each player choosing a die from their set and a table to roll it on. Each player may roll each die once, and each table can only be rolled on once. A single reroll is allowed.

If a player gets a result already rolled by another player, both players may embellish the item description for each other.

Your starting gear will give you some idea of who your character is, discuss with the table.

The starting gear tables can be found at the end of these rules.

### Weapons
lite weapons deal d6 damage and can be concealed easily. Medium weapons deal 1d8 damage. Heavy weapons deal d10 damage and are **Bulky.**

Weapons table can be found at end of these rules.

| Weapon | Cost | Weight | Special |
| ------ | ---- | ------ | ------- |
| Battle-axe | 10sp | Medium | After an attack, roll damage again. If the damage is equal or less than the original attack, attacker may perform a weapon/shield strip. |
| Club | 5sp | lite | Forgo a damage roll to attempt a stun. The target misses their turn and all attacks against them have advantage this round. |
| Dagger | 5sp | lite | Throwable, ignores armour in grapple situations and when the target is prone |
| Flail | 8sp | Medium | Ignores shields. |
| Greatsword* | 40sp | Heavy | Upon a killing blow, the wielder may attack again. This can be chained. |
| Hand-Axe | 6sp | lite | Throwable. If 4+ damage is dealt, the hand-axe bounces to another target, roll damage again. |
| Javelin | 5sp | Medium | Throwable. |
| Longbow* | 30sp | Medium | A round spent aiming grants advantage on the next attack. |
| Longsword | 12sp | Medium | Riposte once per round. |
| Mace | 8sp | Medium | If 4+ damage is dealt, the target loses 1 point of armour permanently. |
| Poleaxe* | 20sp | Heavy | Can use the special of a battle-axe or spear but swapping stance takes one turn in which you have disadvantage on all attacks. |
| Quarterstaff | 5sp | lite | Gives +1 to any combat maneuvers. |
| Shortbow* | 15sp | Medium | Can fire while moving. |
| Shortsword | 8sp | lite | Riposte twice per round. |
| Sling | 1sp | lite | Can be thrown as a bolas to ensnare a target or used as a strangulation device in close quarters. |
| Spear* | 15sp | Heavy | Opponents must make a save to move within range of you. On failure, you get a free attack and they halt their advance. |
| Two-Handed Axe* | 25sp | Heavy | If max damage is rolled, roll another die and add it to the damage. This can be chained. |
| Warhammer* | 25sp | Heavy | Target must make a save or be thrown back and sent prone. |

\* Requires two hands

Advantage - Roll 1d12 for damage regardless of weapon.

Riposte - If hit by <4 damage, you may make a free attack against the attacker.

_These special abilities are just examples of what a weapon might do. You are encouraged to propose further ideas to your DM._

### Armour
Armour provides or increases a character's armour class (AC). When facing damage, a character's AC is subtracted from that damage. A character can not have greater than 3 AC.

Armour is layered to provide cumulative benefit. Wearing lite armour such as a Brigandine and Coif takes two slots, giving 1 AC. Wearing medium armour over the top, such as a chainmail hauberk, takes another two slots and increases AC to 2. Wearing heavy armour over the top of this, such as plate, takes another two slots and increases AC to 3.

| Armour | Cost | Slots | AC |
| ------ | ---- | ------ | -- |
| Brigandine | 15sp | 2 | 1 |
| + Chainmail | 100sp | 2+2=4  | 2 |
| ++ Plate | 250sp | 2+2+2=6 | 3 |
| Shield* | 15sp | 1 Quick | +1 |

\* - Shields can be used alongside other armour to increase AC by 1 but must be in a Quick slot. They can also be sundered at the defender's option to negate all damage from a single source.

## Core Resolution Mechanics
### Saves
When a character is attempting to do something that cannot be resolved through discussion and failure has meaningful consequences, the humble save is employed. A character rolls a number of d6 equal to their most relevant Attribute and attempts to roll a six (success) on at least one die. The number of successes required can be increased by the DM if the situation is especially difficult. Characters may also add to their dice total through various advantages available to them, including appropriate knowledge, good planning, helpful equipment etc.

## Combat
On a side's turn, each character may move and perform one action. If it is unclear which side goes first, each player character must make a Dexterity save to act before the enemy.

### Attacks
An attacker rolls the damage die of their weapon and deals that much damage to the defender's HP. Armour is subtracted from this damage. If an attack is at any meaningful disadvantage, d4 is rolled for damage. If an attack has any meaningful advantage, d12 is rolled.

### Scars
If a character's HP is reduced to exactly 0, they suffer a scar. Look up the damage taken on the scars table below.

| Damage | Scar |
| ------ | ---- |
| 1 | **Battlescar -** A part of you is violently marked. <br /> Roll 1d6: **1** Eye, **2** Cheek, **3** Neck, **4** Chest, **5** Stomach, **6** Hands. <br />Reroll your Maximum HP on a d6 and keep the result if higher. |
| 2 | **Shaken Nerves -** You stammer and shake. <br /> After you take something to calm your nerves, reroll your maximum HP on a d6 and keep the result if higher. |
| 3 | **Hobbled -** Reduced to a limp until fixed. |
| 4 | **Smashed Mouth -** You spit teeth and blood. You look a mess until you see someone who can fix you up. |
| 5 | **Bloody Mess -** You need stitches. Take an injury until it's done by a healer. <br /> Reroll your Maximum HP on 2d6 and keep the result if higher. |
| 6 | **Punctured Organ -** A vital organ is in a critical state. If you are Critically Wounded before seeing a healer you die. <br /> If you get it seen to, reroll your Maximum HP on 2d6 and keep the result if higher. |
| 7 | **Maimed -** A part of you is torn off. <br /> Roll 1d6: **1** Nose, **2** Ear, **3** Finger, **4** Thumb, **5** Eye, **6** Chunk of scalp. |
| 8 | **Torn Limb -** A random limb is torn off or in need of amputation. |
| 9 | **Splintered Mind -** Take an injury until you spend a whole evening emotionally unloading. |
| 10 | **Shattered Ego -** You are dealt a humiliating blow. <br />If you achieve revenge, reroll your Maximum HP on 3d6 and keep the result if higher. |
| 11 | **Fractured Skull -** You feel like a slitely different person. Reroll your Willpower on a d6. |
| 12 | **Doomed to Die -** You shouldn't have survived that. You have nightmares of your own death. <br />If you fail your next save against becoming Critically Wounded, you die horribly. If you pass, remove this effect and reroll your Maximum HP on 3d6 and keep the result if higher. |  


### Wounds
If the defender's HP is reduced to less than 0, the overflow damage fills inventory slots at a rate of 1 slot per damage.

Characters die when all of their slots are filled by wounds

Characters suffering at least 1 damage to their inventory must also make a save using an appropriate attribute or become **Critically Wounded**.

A character who is **Critically Wounded** is unable to do anything but crawl around and groan. They will die of their injuries if left unattended for an hour.

### Deprived
Characters going without a basic need (food, water, sleep etc) or suffering maladies including diseases or poison are considered **Deprived**. 

Deprived characters can not heal their HP through rest.

### Rest
Characters can recover all of their HP after a drink and a few minutes rest.

A character spending at least 1 week in a safe haven can recover all of their wounds, unless the fiction would deem otherwise.
