# Player Rules 1.2.1
## Design Goals
* Equipment based (no classes or skills)
* lite (few rules, easy to learn)
* tite (mechanics are titely coupled)
* Minimal DM overhead
* Interesting player choice at all stages

## Characters
There are three Attributes:

* BODY - measures raw physical power, endurance and dexterity
* MIND - measures mental stability, resolve and force of personality
* LUCK - are you a three or four leaf clover kinda guy?

They are generated by rolling 3d6 three times. Assign the lowest result to LUCK and the other two to BODY and MIND as you see fit.

Characters begin play with:

* d6 HP. This is the damage a character can shrug off before taking more lasting wounds
* Starting gear as per the **Starting Gear** section
* Knowing 1d6/2 languages
    * A language can be 'half-known' - enough to conduct trade
    * All characters should share at least one 'half-known' language - the speech of their ex-captors
    * Language slots can be 'held' for later use, but a character must declare they know a language the first time they hear it
    * If a language is known 'twice', the character is able to read and write in it
* Sharing a small raiding vessel (_Karvi_) with their fellow characters and twelve rowers - fellow ex-thralls who look to you for leadership. There is enough food and water for all hands to survive for four days. You have traveled two days from the home of your ex-captors.


## Equipment
Characters have 10 inventory slots. A character with a full inventory is reduced to 0 HP. Most items take up one slot. **Bulky** items take up two slots. Items small enough to fit in a closed hand don't take any slots.

Consumables provide three uses per slot.

### Starting Gear
Each player gets a set of dice: 1d16, 1d14, 1d12, 1d10, 1d8, 1d6 and 1d4. One die is used to generate starting coins ( 3x die value ), the rest are rolled on the starting gear tables. 

Go around the table, each player choosing a die from their set and a table to roll it on. Each player may roll each die once, and each table can only be rolled on once. A single reroll is allowed.

If a player gets a result already rolled by another player, both players may embellish the item description for each other.

Your starting gear will give you some idea of who your character is, discuss with the table.

The starting gear tables can be found at the end of these rules.

### Weapons
lite weapons deal d6 damage and can be concealed easily. Medium weapons deal 1d8 damage. Heavy weapons deal d10 damage and are **Bulky.**

Weapons table can be found at end of these rules.

| Weapon | Cost | Weight | Special |
| ------ | ---- | ------ | ------- |
| Battle-axe | 10sp | Medium | After an attack, roll damage again. If the damage is equal or less than the original attack, attacker may perform a weapon/shield strip. |
| Club | 5sp | lite | Forgo a damage roll to attempt a stun. The target misses their turn and all attacks against them have advantage this round. |
| Dagger | 5sp | lite | Throwable, ignores armour in grapple situations and when the target is prone |
| Flail | 8sp | Medium | Ignores shields. |
| Greatsword* | 40sp | Heavy | Upon a killing blow, the wielder may attack again. This can be chained. |
| Hand-Axe | 6sp | lite | Throwable. If 4+ damage is dealt, the hand-axe bounces to another target, roll damage again. |
| Javelin | 5sp | Medium | Throwable. |
| Longbow* | 30sp | Medium | A round spent aiming grants advantage on the next attack. |
| Longsword | 12sp | Medium | Riposte once per round. |
| Mace | 8sp | Medium | If 4+ damage is dealt, the target loses 1 point of armour permanently. |
| Poleaxe* | 20sp | Heavy | Can use the special of a battle-axe or spear but swapping stance takes one turn in which you have disadvantage on all attacks. |
| Quarterstaff | 5sp | lite | Gives +1 to any combat maneuvers. |
| Shortbow* | 15sp | Medium | Can fire while moving. |
| Shortsword | 8sp | lite | Riposte twice per round. |
| Sling | 1sp | lite | Can be thrown as a bolas to ensnare a target or used as a strangulation device in close quarters. |
| Spear* | 15sp | Heavy | Opponents must make a save to move within range of you. On failure, you get a free attack and they halt their advance. |
| Two-Handed Axe* | 25sp | Heavy | If max damage is rolled, roll another die and add it to the damage. This can be chained. |
| Warhammer* | 25sp | Heavy | Target must make a save or be thrown back and sent prone. |

\* Requires two hands

Advantage - Roll 1d12 for damage regardless of weapon.

Riposte - If hit by <4 damage, you may make a free attack against the attacker.

_These special abilities are just examples of what a weapon might do. You are encouraged to propose further ideas to your DM._

### Armour
Armour provides or increases a character's armour class (AC). When facing damage, a character's AC is subtracted from that damage. A character can not have greater than 3 AC.

Lite armour provides 1 AC. Medium armour provides 2 AC and is **Bulky**. Heavy armour provides 3 AC, is **Bulky** and will likely cause trouble when attempting to be sneaky or athletic.

Shields can be used alongside other armour to increase AC by 1. They can also be sundered at the defender's option to negate all damage from a single source.

## Core Resolution Mechanics
### Saves
When a character is attempting to do something that cannot be resolved through discussion and failure has meaningful consequences, the humble save is employed. A character rolls a number of d6 equal to their most relevant Attribute and attempts to roll a six (success) on at least one die. The number of successes required can be increased by the DM if the situation is especially difficult. Characters may also add to their dice total through various advantages available to them, including appropriate knowledge, good planning, helpful equipment etc.

## Combat
On a side's turn, each character may move a short distance and perform one action. Alternatively, a character may move a long distance and perform no action.

### Initiative
If neither side is surprised, roll 1d6: **1-3** Opponents go first, **4-6** Players go first.

### Attacks
An attacker rolls the damage die of their weapon and deals that much damage to the defender. 

If more than one character is attacking the same target, all such attackers roll their dice and the highest result is taken. 

Attacks made with significant advantage roll 1d12 instead of the weapon die, those with disadvantage roll 1d4.

### Damage
Damage is removed from HP. 

If a character's HP is reduced to exactly 0, they suffer a scar. Look up the damage taken on the scars table below. 

If a character's HP is reduced below 0, damage is removed from their BODY score and they must make a BODY save with the new score to avoid becoming Critically Wounded. Mental damage/fear is handled the same way but a character's MIND score is used.

Characters die when their BODY is reduced to 0 and go insane ( unplayable ) when their MIND is reduced to 0. Characters reduced to 0 LUCK suffer constant, bizarre mishaps and cannot accomplish anything of significance.

A character who is **Critically Wounded** is unable to do anything but crawl around and groan. They will die of their injuries if left unattended for an hour.

### Scars
| Damage | Scar |
| ------ | ---- |
| 1 | **Battlescar -** A part of you is violently marked. <br /> Roll 1d6: **1** Eye, **2** Cheek, **3** Neck, **4** Chest, **5** Stomach, **6** Hands. <br />Reroll your Maximum HP on a d6 and keep the result if higher. |
| 2 | **Shaken Nerves -** You stammer and shake. <br /> After you manage to calm your nerves, reroll your maximum HP on a d6 and keep the result if higher. |
| 3 | **Hobbled -** Reduced to a limp until fixed. |
| 4 | **Smashed Mouth -** You spit teeth and blood. You look a mess until you see someone who can fix you up. |
| 5 | **Bloody Mess -** You need stitches and are deprived until it's done by a healer. <br /> After, reroll your Maximum HP on 2d6 and keep the result if higher. |
| 6 | **Punctured Organ -** A vital organ is in a critical state, you are deprived until healed. If you are Critically Wounded before seeing a healer you die. <br /> If you get it seen to, reroll your Maximum HP on 2d6 and keep the result if higher. |
| 7 | **Maimed -** A part of you is torn off. <br /> Roll 1d6: **1** Nose, **2** Ear, **3** Finger, **4** Thumb, **5** Eye, **6** Chunk of scalp. |
| 8 | **Torn Limb -** A random limb is torn off or in need of amputation. |
| 9 | **Splintered Mind -** You are deprived until you have a Long Rest. After, make a MIND save. Failure means you must reroll your MIND score. |
| 10 | **Shattered Ego -** You are dealt a humiliating blow. <br />If you achieve revenge, reroll your Maximum HP on 3d6 and keep the result if higher. |
| 11 | **Fractured Skull -** You feel like a slitely different person. Reroll your MIND score. |
| 12 | **Doomed to Die -** You shouldn't have survived that. You have nightmares of your own death. <br />If you fail your next save against becoming Critically Wounded, you die horribly. If you pass, remove this effect and reroll your Maximum HP on 3d6 and keep the result if higher. |  

### Deprived
Characters going without a basic need (food, water, sleep etc) or suffering maladies including diseases, poisons and some scars are considered **Deprived**. 

Deprived characters can not recover HP or Attributes.

Deprived characters suffer 1 Fatigue per day, which fills an inventory slot and lasts until they take a Long Rest.

### Rest
There are three types of rest:

- Short Rest: Takes 1 Turn. A swig of water/wine and a moment to catch one's breath is enough to restore 1d6 HP.
- Long Rest: Takes 1 Watch. A meal and some sleep will restore all HP and Fatigue, and allow a character to recover 1d6 in BODY **or** MIND.
- Full Rest: Takes a week or more of downtime. A character fully recovers HP, Fatigue, Attributes and most long term conditions.

## Advice
### Character Introduction Script
At the start of each session, follow these dot-points when asked to (re)describe your character to the table.

1. Gross physical features ( gender, race, age, build, etc )
2. Arms, Armour and Clothing ( make sure to detail where all visible weapons are carried )
3. Symbols, Decorations and their Meanings or Context
4. Unique feature or Personality Signifier
5. Recently revealed Fun Fact (Re-introductions only)

### Player Principles
**Agency**

- Attributes, Saves and Special Abilities do not define your character. They are but tools that you have at hand.
- Don't ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do, too.
- Be creative with your intuition, items and connections.

**Teamwork**

- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.

**Exploration**

- Asking questions and paying attention to detail is more useful than anything on your character sheet.
- Take what the GM says without suspicion, but don't shy away from seeking more information.
- There is no single correct way forward.

**Talking**

- Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
- You'll find that most people are interesting and wil want to talk things through before using violence.

**Caution**

- Fighting is rarely the only choice; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
- Try to stack the odds in your favour and retreat when things seem unfavorable.

**Planning**

- Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety and fact finding.
- Do some research and ask around about your objectives.

**Ambition**

- Set goals and use your means to take steps forward.
- Expect nothing. Earn your reputation.
- Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.
