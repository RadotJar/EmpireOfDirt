# Class Ideas
*On adding classes to OOOOOSR. This is currently just food for thought*

## Arguments For Classes
- Greater role/identity at character creation > encourages everyone to do 'their thing'
- Clearer mechanical advancement
- Just kinda neat, I like old school concepts (See Dark and Darker)
- Easier integration with assumptions from other systems, easier to hack ideas from them that revolve around classes/levelling up etc.

## Arguments Against Classes
- Pigeon hole characters
- Greater chance of 'character sheet syndrome', less creativity from players
- There are probably other systems that do classes better already
- Less lite

## Ideas
### Starting Gear Tables Determined by Class
The system is still inventory based, but the starting gear tables are different depending on class.

*E.g: Fighter rolls once on Armour, twice on Weapons, once on Heirlooms, once on Traits. Cleric rolls once on Armour, once on Weapons, once on Holy Relics, once on Heirlooms, once on Traits.*

In this example, each holy relic may unlock a different 'school' of divine magic.

Armour, Weapons, Heirlooms and Traits could all be bespoke tables for each class as well, to fit each more thematically. Reminiscent of *Freebooters on the Frontier*, where wizards roll traits like 'crazy hair, long fingernails' and fighters roll things like 'scarred face, beefy arms'.

In this way, the traditional class power/advancement trope can mesh with the existing item based system.
