## Travel
### Navigation and Lost
Characters see into adjacent hexes. Mountains are visible from 4 hexes away. Weather conditions may hamper visibility.

When no landmark can be seen, characters have a 2-in-6 chance of becoming lost, 4-in-6 in storms. Hide any map and continue play without reference to it, until they are able to re-establish their location. Movement is in a random direction.

### Land
Encounter 1-in-6 chance every 12 hours.

| Wagons/Carts            | 3                                         |

*- Vessel does not require a port and is light enough to be beached.

River speed is halved when moving against the current.
A '/' tells of the ratio of 'crew' to marines.
Value is the ransom paid for the return of a captured vessel - triple this to pay for a new one.
<br/>

#### Wind
Wind persists for 1d6 days. Wind direction changes each day, initial direction rolled randomly. Characters know of a storm 1 day before it arrives.

**Storm:** 30% chance of capsizing per day. Lose loose cargo and 40% chance of sinking before being righted by crew. Ignore ship encounters.

Use first number for sailing with the wind, second if one direction over.

| 2d6  | Wind Strength | Hexes per day | - | 1d6 | Direction Change |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------- | - | - | - |
| 2-3  | Calm          | None          |  | 1-2 | 1 Direction clockwise |
| 4-8  | Light Breeze  | +1/+1         |  | 3-4 | No change |
| 9-11 | Strong Breeze | +2/+1         |  | 5-6 | 1 Direction Anti-Clockwise|
| 12   | Gale/Storm    | +3/+2         |  |  |  |

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

#### Naval Encounters
Encounter 1-in-6 chance per day.

Encounters on Coasts and the Ocean are spotted at a distance of a hex. Reaction!!
If River curvature is unknown, River encounters are spotted at 3d6*10'.

| 1d12 | River               | Coast               | Ocean          |

### Chris McDowall DM Advice
#### Treasure
- Value exceeds usefulness
- Reason it isn't claimed
- Doesn't need to be complex, can provoke thought
- **Big, Heavy, Useless, Valuable**

#### Adventure
- Place the treasure somewhere dangerous but interesting
- A map and table of encounters
- List immediately obvious features of rooms, characters, paths etc.
- In parentheses, list the details that characters can only discover through play
- Fit as many notes as you can on the map
- Start with broad ideas
- Go through each one by one and add a new detail that wouldn't be assumed. Repeat
- **Information, Choice, Impact** 
- More dangerous threats should be more obvious
- Don't create soft threats, should have impact

#### The Rival
- Somebody else always has the same lead as the group
- The rival is better than the group or their polar opposite
- Some lackeys, focus on the rival

#### Encounters
- 6 encounters on a table
- Can be similar people with different behaviours or group composition
- At least one result very dangerous
- List 3 things that the encounter does. Frequent responses or interesting abilities
    - Infuse with drives and motives. Tie into location
- **Drive, Impact, Flavour**

#### Foreground Growth
- Character growth happens through play, not in downtime
- Characters grow more interesting, not necessarily more powerful
