# Dungeon Master's Rules - 0.6.0
*Turn back, all ye who haven't the stomach for this hobby so consuming.*

## Design Goals
* Simple
* Usable
* Modular
* Reference-style

## Monsters
Die at 0 HP.

## Surprise, Reaction, Distance
Unaware parties are surprised 2-in-6 of the time.

| 2d6  | Reaction |
| ---- | -------- |
| 2-   | Hostile  |
| 3-5  | Negative Inclination |
| 6-8  | Disinterested |
| 9-11 | Positive Inclination |
| 12+  | Friendly |

If surprised, 1d6\*10' away. Otherwise, 2d6\*10' away.

## Morale
| 2d6  | Action |
| ---- | ------ |
| 2-   | Disorganised retreat - those left behind surrender |
| 3-6  | Organised retreat |
| 7+   | Morale holds |

## Travel
*Hexes are assuemd to be 6 miles across*

### Navigation and Lost
Characters see into adjacent hexes. Mountains are visible from 4 hexes away. Weather conditions may hamper visibility.

When no landmark can be seen, characters have a 2-in-6 chance of becoming lost, 4-in-6 in storms. Hide any map and continue play without reference to it, until they are able to re-establish their location. Movement is in a random direction.

*- Vessel does not require a port and is light enough to be beached.

River speed is halved when moving against the current.
A '/' tells of the ratio of 'crew' to marines.
Value is the ransom paid for the return of a captured vessel - triple this to pay for a new one.
<br/>

#### Wind
Wind persists for 1d6 days. Characters know of a storm 1 day before it arrives.

Wind direction changes each day, initial direction rolled randomly.

Use first number for sailing with the wind, second if one direction over.

| ---- | ------------- | ------------- | - | - | - |
| 2-3  | Calm          | None          |  | 1-2 | 1 Direction clockwise |
| 4-8  | Light Breeze  | +1/+1         |  | 3-4 | No change |
| 9-11 | Strong Breeze | +2/+1         |  | 5-6 | 1 Direction Anti-Clockwise|
| 12   | Gale/Storm    | +3/+2         |  |  |  |


#### Storms
30% chance of capsizing per day. Lose loose cargo and 40% chance of sinking before being righted by crew. Ignore ship encounters.
