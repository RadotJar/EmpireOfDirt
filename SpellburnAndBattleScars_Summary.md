# Spellburn and Battlescars: Rules Summary

## Character Creation
- d6 HP
- HP value provides a choice or roll between three backgrounds

*Example Background selection:*

*2HP:* 

1. ***Ale Brewer** - Hireling: Drunken torchbearer; Small barrel of ale.*
2. ***Farmer** - Whistle; Chicken*
3. ***Librarian** - Obscure book; Quill & ink**

- 3 Attributes: BODY, MIND, LUCK.
    - Roll 2d6+3 three times. Lowest value is LUCK, assign other two
    - If not satisfied with stats, you may be a normal person and have 10 in all
    - LUCK can be burned to add to rolls. Also spent by clerics when casting miracles, fluctuates with other things like fucking with gods, performing great deeds etc.

- An archetype: Fighter, Cleric, Wizard, Thief, Dwarf, Elf, Halfling. Each archetype provides:
    - Starting Gear
    - Special abilities
    - Minor ability from answering an origin question
    - Archetypes are very hackable. Easy to make new ones/come up with custom origin questions and abilities

*Example Archetype:*

*Elf*

***Starting Gear***

*Elegant Sword (d8), Recurve Bow (d8), Gilt Clothing (1 Armor), Grimoire (Charm or Detect Magic, bulky), Silken Rope*

***Origin - Which skill have you mastered over the years?***

1. ***Lore Master** - If you don't know a certain piece of knowledge, you know where to start searching.*
2. ***Seer** - Once per session, burn 1 LUCK and ask the GM a Yes/No question, they will answer truthfully.*
3. ***Wanderer** - You know how to orient yourself by looking at the stars.*

***Special Abilities***

*Begin with one. Gain another when you **Recover a Treasure** or **Amend with Nature***

- ***Ancient Mind** - You're immune to magical sleep and paralysis.*
- ***Arcane by Nature** - Once per day, you can make a LUCK Save to ignore a spell mishap.*
- ***Heightened Senses** - You get a 'weird feeling' when there's a secret passage close to you*
- ***Precise Grace** - So long as you are aware of the threat, you can never be disarmed.*

( All archetypes advance if they **Recover a Treasure**, each then has their own personal advancement trigger. )

- Three days' Rations (one slot)
- A torch (one slot)
- 10 Golden Pieces

## Inventory
- 10 slots
- A full inventory reduces you to 0 HP
- 1 item per slot, bulky = 2, tiny shit doesn't count
- Yes there is le epic gear shopping table

## Combat
- Side-based initiative
- Auto damage rolls, Armor reduces damage (max 3 armor)
- Everyone declares if they're attacking a target. Highest roll among everyone attacking each target is taken as the damage
- d12 for advantage damage, d4 for disadvantage
- Damage dealt to HP, then BODY. Pass a BODY save or become critically wounded ( die if not tended to for an hour )
- Scars if exactly 0HP (like my table but improved)
- Death at 0 BODY

## Deprived and Fatigue
- Deprived characters (lacking food, water, sleep, sometimes magical reasons) can't recover HP or Attribute damage. Each day Deprived characters fill an inventory slot with fatigue.

## Rest and Healing
- **Short Rest** - Takes 1 Turn. A swig of water and a few minutes rest restores d6+1HP
- **Long Rest** - Takes 1 Watch. A meal and some sleep will restore all HP. Also restores d6+1 to BODY and MIND, removes all Fatigue.
- **Full Rest** - A week back in safety. Restores all BODY and MIND and removes long-term conditions.

## Advancement
- Recover a treasure or meet your archetype's trigger, then return to safety.
- Each recovered treasure can only be used to advance one character.
- Roll d20 for each attribute, increase by 1 if roll is higher than current score
- Increase HP by 1
- Get a new special ability from archetype ( perhaps create own )

## Magic
- Scrolls are single use
- Grimoires contain multiple spells and are bulky
- Decide a Power level for the spell up to the number of empty inventory slots you have, capped at 5. Roll that many d6, spell effect is determined by number of Dice and total Sum.
- Each die that shows 4-6 gives 1 Fatigue
- If two or more dice show same number, magical mishap on the mishap table

*Example Spell:*

***Light** - Force [DICE] creatures to make a MIND Save or become stunned. Alternatively, create light as bright as a torch for [SUM] turns.*
